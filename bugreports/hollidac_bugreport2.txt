Fault occurs when the steward card is activated and the number of cards that every other player than current has fails to update. Detected using cardtest1.c 

Detected on the version of dominion located in the repository owned by "hollidac".

Possible Fault Location:
  //Each other player draws a card
  for (i = 0; i < state->numPlayers; i++) { 
    if (i != currentPlayer) { 
      drawCard(i, state);
    } 
  } 

Test case:
  struct gameState G;
  struct gameState *p = &G;

  int seed = 123456789;
  int k[10] = {council_room, gardens, embargo, village, minion, mine, cutpurse, 
    sea_hag, tribute, smithy};
  initializeGame(2, k, seed, p);

  p->hand[0][0] = council_room;
  endTurn(p);
  assertTrue(numHandCards(p) == 5 + 1, "numHandCards(p) == 5 + 1"); //Starting cards + 1 drawn
                                     //BUG: should be 5 + 1
